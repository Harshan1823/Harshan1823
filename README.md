## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a Data enthisiast with a strong focus on building end-to-end production pipleines to develop ML applications. I am currently working as a Research Assistant under Virtusos team to develop and research on real-world applications levearging AI.

I am open to new opportunities where I can apply my skills to solve complex problems and drive innovation. With nearly 3 years of experience in the data space with expertise in Pharma, Finance and E-commerce industries. My expertise spans Python, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Node.js, Java, Terraform, and various cloud platforms including AWS, Azure and GCP.

Feel free to explore my projects below and connect with me for opportunities to collaborate or discuss potential roles.


## Currently Working On

1. **TagMyCompaint:** Our project aims to streamline complaint resolution by automatically categorizing consumer complaints using a hybrid approach that combines fine-tuned DistilBERT for product and issue classification with traditional machine learning models for sub-products and sub-issues. This reduces manual errors and enhances routing efficiency, ensuring faster complaint handling.

2. **GeneSQL:** GeneSQL is a project focused on leveraging text-to-SQL models to enable natural language querying of structured databases. By integrating advanced NLP techniques, the system translates user queries into SQL commands, simplifying database interactions and making data retrieval more intuitive for non-technical users.

3. **RAG Enchancements:** We are currently focused on optimizing the existing RAG framework by integrating advanced techniques inspired by Anthropic research and leveraging state-of-the-art re-ranking methodologies to significantly enhance the relevance and precision of the systemâ€™s responses.


## Key Projects

- **FiNER**: FiNER is a financial entity recognition system designed to identify 139 distinct entity tags within company filings submitted to the SEC during quarterly reports. The solution leverages advanced NLP techniques, including RNNs, LSTMs, and a custom transformer architecture, to accurately classify and extract financial entities, thereby streamlining the analysis of complex regulatory documents.

- **Activity Identification** - The real-time activity recognition project utilizes Amazon Go data to accurately identify and classify customer actions within the store environment. By leveraging state-of-the-art computer vision models, including YOLO for object detection and Vision Transformers for action recognition, the system effectively captures and interprets customer behaviors, enabling enhanced insights into shopping patterns and improving automated checkout experiences.

- **LLM's on domain specifics** - In this project, I implemented Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) by leveraging various adapters to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) for answering domain-specific queries. This approach enabled efficient parameter updates, reducing training overhead while preserving model performance. The fine-tuned model demonstrated improved accuracy in generating targeted responses, making it a robust solution for handling specialized domain questions.
